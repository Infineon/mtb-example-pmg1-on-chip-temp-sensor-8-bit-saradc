## Hardware setup

1.	Connect the board to your PC using a USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector (J1). This cable is used for programming the PMG1 device and can be used during debugging. In addition, it transfers the UART data from the serial port to the PC, to display it on a serial monitor.

2.	Connect the USB PD port (J10) to a USB-C power adapter/USB port on PC using a Type-C/Type-A to Type-C cable, to power the PMG1 device for normal operation.

3.	Connect the UART Tx and UART Rx lines from the PMG1 kit to J3.8 and J3.10 on KitProg3 respectively, to establish a UART connection between KitProg3 and the PMG1 device for the below mentioned revisions of the PMG1 prototyping kits. Note that, in this application, UART Tx line alone will be used to transmit the temperature data onto serial monitor.
     
    **Table 1. PMG1 kit UART connection**    

    | PMG1 prototyping kit  | UART Tx | UART Rx |
    | :-------       | :------------ | :----------     |
    | PMG1-CY7110 (revision 3 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10  |
    | PMG1-CY7111 (revision 2 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10  |
    | PMG1-CY7112 (revision 2 or lower) | J6.10 to J3.8 | J6.9 to J3.10  |

   **Note:** All prototyping kits with a higher revision have UART lines internally connected. Therefore, external wiring is not required.  

See the kit user guide for more details on configuring the board.


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator to display the serial data. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **quick panel**.

Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector and the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 1-2.

See the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on the CY7110 prototyping kit. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


## Design and implementation

This code example uses the BJT based temperature sensor (BJT NPN device) in the ADC block of PMG1 devices, by channeling it to the input of 8-bit SAR ADC under USB PD block, through firmware controlled multiplexer switches. The BJT VBE voltage, which is highly temperature dependent, is the input to the 8-bit ADC, with reference voltage of Vref = 2.0V (Bandgap reference) for PMG1-S0 and S1 and Vref = VDDA for PMG1-S2 (as Bandgap reference voltage is not available on PMG1-S2 device). The output code of the ADC is then converted to corresponding temperature value, using appropriate conversion formula and suitable calibration parameters (slope & offset values). The value of the macros in the source file, 'TEMP_SLOPE' and 'TEMP-OFFSET' can be adjusted to fine-tune the output of this application, on different PMG1 kits. The accuracy and resolution of the resultant temperature sensor is limited to around five degree celsius on PMG1-S0 and PMG1-S1 and around eight degree celsius on PMG1-S2 (due to a higher Vref value being used). The working range of the internal temperature sensor is from -40C to +85C.

- **USB-C Power Delivery 0** block is enabled under 'Peripherals' tab in Device Configurator tool. Note that, under 'Inputs' section, **Clock SAR** is assigned with '8 bit Divider 2 clk' with a divider value of 48, resulting in 1MHz clock frequency applied to the 8-bit SAR ADC as shown in the below image. USB PD Stack is also initialized with suitable parameters to allow the usage of the 8-bit SAR ADC of the USB PD block.

  **Figure 2. 8-bit SAR ADC enabled under USB-C Power Delivery 0 block**

  <img src = "images/usb-pd-block.png" width = "800"/>

- Serial Communication Block (SCB) is also enabled and configured as UART to allow serial UART communication, to send the temperature data on to the serial port.

- The user switch (SW2) is configured to trigger a GPIO interrupt in the falling edge. Upon pressing the switch, the corresponding ISR is used to save the status of the switch and trigger the SAR ADC to read the voltage of the BJT temperature sensor and convert it to the corresponding temperature value.

- The user LED (LED3) is also configured as output, which toggles the state to indicate the temperature data being sent to the UART serial port.
